## __DESCRIPTION__
This code was used as a training exercise to practice coding in java. 

The design pattern followed by the code is based on the Model-View-Controller [(MVC)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/MVC) or more precisely Model-View-ViewController-Controller pattern.

The view is managed using the JavaFXML framework [(MVN repository link)](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.openjfx/javafx-fxml).

## __USAGE__
This is a simple game designed while learning how to code with Java. Two players are needed to play this game of connect four no single player mode has been implemented. To play they must click on simple visual interface representation of the grided vertical board.

The program detects the column where the player clicked and places chip in the lowest possible row similar to the analogue game. then changes the player's turn until it detects either player has won. Then the game can be restarted.
